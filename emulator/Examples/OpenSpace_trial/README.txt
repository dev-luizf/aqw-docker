OPENSPACE TRIAL EDITION LIMITATIONS

This trial version of OpenSpace comes with some limitations:

- the "POWERED BY OPENSPACE" link appears at the top right corner of the OpenSpace viewport;
- the OpenSpace Editor can export maps with a maximum size of 15x15 tiles only: larger maps will be trimmed down to the maximum allowed size;
- during map loading the OpenSpace logo and link are displayed, together with a loading progress bar;
- when the skin of an avatar is changed (through the "OpenSpace.setMyAvatarSkin" method), this action is not broadcasted to the other clients;
